# Exploratory Data Anaysis

This project has the purpose to apply what I have learned in inferential statistics such as bootstrapping, confidence interval, hypothesis testing and other tools for data analysis like categorization, binnig,  etc.

The data used for this project was found in (Principles of Economics)[http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/poe5/poe5csv.html]
