# Exploratory Data Anaysis

This project has the purpose to apply what I have learned in inferential statistics such as bootstrapping, hypothesis testing, categorization, and more.

The data used for this project was found in (Principles of Economics)[http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/poe5/poe5csv.html]
